# DataDashboard

	This is a redraft version of the dashboard I created when doing an internship in Refond Equipment Compay. The PHP and server setup is credited to Ray Villalobos. 
	This project is mainly a demonstration of the way I used to present data that transferred to the cloud server. I am using C3, an open source library to draw the chart. Due to the setup of the server, I have to collect the data per second.
