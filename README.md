# DataDashboard

  This is a redraft version of the dashboard I created when doing an internship in Refond Equipment Compay. The PHP and server setup is credited to Ray Villalobos. 

  This project is mainly a demonstration of the way I used to present data that transferred to the cloud server. I am using C3, an open source library to draw the chart. Due to the setup of the server, I have to collect the data per second. 
  
  By clicking the "Collect Data button!", it would start to generate the chart per seconds, and would automatically record the starting time. 
  
  When clicking "Stop!" button, the chart would stop collecting new data and would automatically record the end time. 
  
  The "Reset!" button was used to clear and unload the pervious data.
